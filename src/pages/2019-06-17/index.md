Very likely this course is the best indtroduction course into machine learning. Charismatic lecturer legibly and without undue information explains in detail all main concepts related with machine learning field. Every session supported by good examples and relevant tasks.

Miminal entry threshold. It is difficult not to understand something. Competently shown how machine learning algorithms work under the hood. No magic, just math. I think this course is must have for everyone, because it set the right direction for further development.

## Pros

1. Well structured. Predictable. Things compartmentalized.
2. Well clear academic english.

## Cons

1. Octave. I personally prefer Python. Python is mainstream. So If course would use python instead of octave it would be ideal course.

Thank you, Andrew.
