{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After long and difficult process of writing my dissertation I decided to structure knowledge gained during the studies. For this I decided to take an online course. After examining many reviews and responses I drew attention on John Hopkins «Data science specialization». Completed course in my spare time in 5-6 hours per week. Now it is time to share my own review.</p>\n<p>First of all, it is worth noting that specialization seems to have done the job on 100 percent. I am satisfied with gained knowledge. After completing the course I got full understanding of what data science is and which skills I should develop.</p>\n<h2>Pros</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Well structured. After completing the course you get full understanding of real research steps.</li>\n<li>Well balanced. Large amount of necessary theory supported with real practical examples. The course is simple in terms of understanding, however, has large amount of usefull information.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Last course of specialization (capstone project) is not related to previous specialization steps. Knowledge gained from first nine courses is not useful in capstone project.</li>\n<li>Personally, I prefer Python. However, study of R language was very useful and interesting.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Coursera & John Hopkins «Data science specialization» review","date":"24 May 2019","tags":["Courses"]}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/jogn-hopkins-data-science-specialization-review","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/test-post","title":"Test article","tags":["Tag"]}},"next":null}}
